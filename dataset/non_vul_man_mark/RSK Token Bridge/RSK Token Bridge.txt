 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.

 *

 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector

 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the

 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two

 * things that go hand in hand:

 *

 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if

 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.

 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the

 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says

 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".

 *

 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing

 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due

 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.

 *

 * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,

 * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.

 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC777} interface.

 *

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

 *

 * Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both

 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.

 * Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token

 * movements.

 *

 * Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there

 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or

 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.

/**

 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC777} interface.

 *

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

 *

 * Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both

 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.

 * Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token

 * movements.

 *

 * Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there

 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or

 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.

 * @dev Implementation of the {IERC777} interface.

 *

 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means

 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.

 *

 * Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both

 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.

 * Both {IERC777-Sent} and {IERC20-Transfer} events are emitted on token

 * movements.

 *

 * Additionally, the {IERC777-granularity} value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there

 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or

 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.

/**

 * @dev This contract implements a proxy that is upgradeable by an admin.

 *

 * To avoid https://medium.com/nomic-labs-blog/malicious-backdoors-in-ethereum-proxies-62629adf3357[proxy selector

 * clashing], which can potentially be used in an attack, this contract uses the

 * https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-transparent-proxy-pattern/[transparent proxy pattern]. This pattern implies two

 * things that go hand in hand:

 *

 * 1. If any account other than the admin calls the proxy, the call will be forwarded to the implementation, even if

 * that call matches one of the admin functions exposed by the proxy itself.

 * 2. If the admin calls the proxy, it can access the admin functions, but its calls will never be forwarded to the

 * implementation. If the admin tries to call a function on the implementation it will fail with an error that says

 * "admin cannot fallback to proxy target".

 *

 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing

 * the admin, so it's best if it's a dedicated account that is not used for anything else. This will avoid headaches due

 * to sudden errors when trying to call a function from the proxy implementation.

 *

 * Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,

 * you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.
