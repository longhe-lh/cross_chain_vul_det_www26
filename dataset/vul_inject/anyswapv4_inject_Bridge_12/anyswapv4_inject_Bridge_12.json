The attacker used a crafted transaction to call the anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit function before a legitimate user's transaction could execute. The function assumed the underlying token (WETH) supported the ERC-2612 permit interface, but WETH lacked the permit method. Consequently, the fallback deposit function was triggered instead of validating the signature. The attacker then successfully used safeTransferFrom to transfer the WETH to their own address without proper authorization, gaining approximately 87 ETH (~$130,000)."}
