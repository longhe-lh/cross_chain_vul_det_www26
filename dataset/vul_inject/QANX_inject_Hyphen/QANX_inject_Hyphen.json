This fake contract's deposit behavior made it accept any input QANX amount as a parameter while only transferring 1 QANX internally. The fake contract created a transaction hash (`txid`) that looked legitimate and submitted this hash to the real QANX Bridge's signing nodes for authorization. Because the `verifySignature` function did not validate the transaction's `to` field (`tx.to`), the signing nodes failed to differentiate between the fake contract and the legitimate bridge contract, signing the malicious transaction. This allowed the attacker to withdraw 4.5 million QANX tokens from Ethereum, even though only 1 QANX token was legitimately bridged to the BSC chain."}
