By supplying a forged signatory, an attacker was able to bypass the authorization process. Due to the absence of mapping key validation in Solidity, the system calculated an unreasonably high quota for the forged signatory, enabling the attacker to mint and withdraw unauthorized funds. The root cause is improper validation of mapping-based access control. Additionally, the platform had reduced the required number of signatures to 1 prior to the attack, making exploitation easier."}
