The malicious contract triggered the `deposit` event and allowed the attacker to arbitrarily craft the `asset` and `amount` parameters, along with an invalid `memo`. This invalid `memo` disrupted the THORChain node's processing logic, forcing it into the refund logic path. Because the refund logic didnâ€™t properly validate the entire transaction, the attacker was able to gain profits without transferring any legitimate value."}
