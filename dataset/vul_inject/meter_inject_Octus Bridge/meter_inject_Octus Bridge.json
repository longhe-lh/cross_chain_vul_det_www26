Normally, WETH or WBNB should only be deposited via depositETH(), which handles asset wrapping and ensures actual value is transferred. However, deposit() allowed deposits for any resourceID—including those mapped to WBNB—without checking if tokens were truly received or burned. The attacker exploited this by submitting a fake deposit using a crafted resourceID that resolved to the WBNB contract address, but without sending real tokens. Since no validation was enforced and the event was indistinguishable from a legitimate deposit, the relayers propagated the deposit event to target chains (Ethereum, Moonriver), where equivalent tokens were minted and withdrawn by the attacker. This resulted in severe financial loss, as no real assets backed the minted tokens. The root cause lies in inconsistent validation paths between depositETH() and deposit(), and the lack of enforcement for secure asset custody when dealing with wrapped native tokens."}
